# Vulkan Tutorial

## 13th March, 2023

This will host the files from the classic [Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com).

This was my first Vulkan tutorial I completed a few years ago, but I will do it all again and host it here.

The plan is to do all Vulkan tutorials I can find in C++ and Rust.

At some point I will start noticing patterns and get familiar with the API by heart.

I completed the Vulkano one in Rust already. However, Vulkano is a bit higher level than the actual Vulkan API, so I will dig in lower-level tutorials now and keep revisiting them until I grasp the concepts by hearth.
