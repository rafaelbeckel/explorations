# Vulkan Tutorial

## 13th March, 2023

This will host the files from the [VkGuide tutorial](https://vkguide.dev).

I read on Reddit that it's a great complement to the classic Vulkan Tutorial I did a few years ago, and it teaches more real-world scenarios like implementing it in a game engine.

As I wrote in other README files around this repo, I plan to follow every Vulkan tutorial I can find in C++ and Rust.
At some point I will start noticing patterns and get familiar with the API by heart.

I completed the Vulkano one in Rust already. However, Vulkano is a bit higher level than the actual Vulkan API, so I will dig in lower-level tutorials now and keep revisiting them until I grasp the concepts by hearth.

I will start this one today.
