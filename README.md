# Personal Explorations in Art and Code

I created this repository to document my work and learnings about the intersection of programming and art – a place where my two passions can dialogue and inform one another. It will consist in a collection of projects, artwork, articles, drafts, and references for my future self, friends, partners, clients and collectors. Welcome!

This is a living document and is very likely to change frequently.

## Artist's Statement

As a software engineer and visual artist, I am constantly seeking new ways to combine the precision and control of code with the expressive potential of paint and canvas. My goal is to find a way to truly blend traditional art with programming in unique and unexpected ways.

My current focus is on exploring the potential of generative art techniques to create figurative works. While most of the generative art that exists today is abstract, I am interested in finding new ways to use these techniques to create expressive, narrative-driven pieces that tell stories and capture the human experience, using traditional media as inputs or outputs of carefully handcrafted software.

## Vista Programming Language

One way to achieve my vision and develop a unique style is to create a domain-specific programming language for painting, that uses the language of drawing and painting as its syntax. This project is in the very early stages, but I hope to share more about it in the future.

## Is it AI Art?

No, I do not use AI image generation in my art. A primary driver for my explorations is deep understanding of what I'm drawing or building, and generating images from a prompt steals this experience.

While I do admire the technical achievement of these tools, and eventually play with them out of curiosity, I think they cannot replace the human element that is at the heart of truly creative art.


## Inspiring quotes:

I'll pick one **Art** Quote and one **Computer Science** Quote.

Andrew Loomis wrote this in the "Opening Chat" section of his masterpiece **Creative Illustration**, from 1947. He was referring to photography, but this is still relevant and perfectly applies to AI Art today:

> "Devoid of personality, creative art would have little reason for existence. In fact, the individual expression is its greatest value, the thing that **forever** lifts it above picture-making achieved by mechanical means.

>   —Andrew Loomis (June 15, 1892 – May 25, 1959)

This is the Dedication page of the classic book **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**, by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, 1996:

> **Dedication:**
>
> This book is dedicated, in respect and admiration, to the spirit that lives in the computer.

> “I think that it’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don’t think we are. I think we’re responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don’t become missionaries. Don’t feel as if you’re Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don’t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What’s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.”
