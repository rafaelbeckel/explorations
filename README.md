# Personal Explorations in Art and Code

I created this repository to document my work and personal learnings about the intersection of programming and art â€“ a place where my two passions can dialogue and inform one another. It will consist in a collection of projects, artwork, articles, drafts, and references for my future self, friends, partners, clients and collectors. Welcome!

This is a living document and is very likely to change frequently.

## Artist's Statement

From a young age, I have been captivated by the power of both art and technology. As I grew and pursued a career in software engineering, I found myself continually drawn back to my creative roots.

As a software engineer and visual artist, I am constantly seeking new ways to combine the precision and control of code with the expressive potential of paint and canvas. Through my work, I hope to push the boundaries of what is possible in both technology and painting, and to inspire others to pursue their own creative passions.

My current focus is on exploring the potential of generative art techniques to create figurative works. While most of the generative art that exists today is abstract, I am interested in finding new ways to use these techniques to create expressive, narrative-driven pieces that tell stories and capture the human experience, using traditional media as inputs or outputs of carefully handcrafted software.

## Thoughts about AI Art

There is a wide range of opinions on the topic of AI art, and people's feelings about it can vary significantly. Because of the recent discussions about it in the art community, I feel I need to place my work into this context.

Andrew Loomis wrote this in the "Opening Chat" section of his masterpiece Creative Illustration, from 1947. He was referring to photography, but this is still relevant today and perfectly applies to AI Art:

> "Devoid of personality, creative art would have little reason for existence. In fact, the individual expression is its greatest value, the thing that **forever** lifts it above picture-making achieved by mechanical means.
>
> (Andrew Loomis, 1947)

I believe this sentiment is shared by many artists, and, more importantly, by many collectors and consumers of art, who value the unique perspective an artwork brings to existence. They know it speaks more about its creator than about the subject it depicts. While AI can be seen as a threat to many, it cannot replace the human element that is at the heart of truly creative art.

Humans will continue buying art from other humans, and art has this inherent personal value for both the creator and the consumer that nothing can replace. It connects people through generations and documents the human experience through history.
