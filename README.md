# Personal Explorations in Art and Code

### Artist's Statement

From a young age, I have been captivated by the power of both art and technology. As I grew and pursued a career in software engineering, I found myself continually drawn back to my creative roots. This repository is a collection of my personal learnings at the intersection of programming and art â€“ a place where my two passions intersect and inform one another. 

As a software engineer and visual artist, I am constantly seeking new ways to combine the precision and control of code with the expressive potential of paint and canvas. Through my work, I hope to push the boundaries of what is possible in both technology and painting, and to inspire others to pursue their own creative passions.

My current focus is on exploring the potential of generative art techniques to create figurative works. While most of the generative art that exists today is abstract, I am interested in finding new ways to use these techniques to create expressive, narrative-driven pieces that tell stories and capture the human experience, using traditional media as inputs or outputs of carefully handcrafted software.
