# Topics, Projects and Tools

- Programming languages: I am particularly interested in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a systems programming language known for its performance and safety features.
- Creative coding: I enjoy using frameworks such as [Nannou](https://nannou.cc/), [P5.js](https://p5js.org/), and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to create interactive and generative artworks.
- Graphics programming: I am fascinated by the power of technologies like [WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/), [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/), [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/), and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) to create stunning graphics and visuals.
- Traditional and digital artworks: I enjoy working with a variety of mediums, including graphite and charcoal, oil paint, and digital tools like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [Procreate](https://procreate.art/). All artworks included in this repository are licensed under creative commons with attribution because sharing is caring.

## What I will purposely leave out

There are many articles about Software Engineering and building software in a business environment.

This is primarily about having fun and exploring weird or niche technology that may produce something beautiful in the end.
