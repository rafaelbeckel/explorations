Some people are worried that AI will replace artists. I don't think so. When photography was invented, many artists feared it would replace their work. But it didn't. It became a new medium, and artists adapted to it by using it to create new kinds of art. The same will happen with AI art. It will be a new medium, and artists will adapt to it by using it to create new kinds of art.


## How I use AI in my Art

Let's start by saying I do **not** use image-generation tools in my art. A primary driver for my explorations is deep understanding of what I'm drawing or building, and generating images from a prompt steals this experience.

Sometimes I spend my free DALL-E monthly credits to generate some random garbage that nobody will see besides me. It's a personal moodboard of sorts, but less than 1% of my sources of inspiration. I mainly use it for producing funny results with bogus prompts, to reveal biases and test the limits of the system. I also follow `r/weirddalle` on Reddit and Twitter for the lulz.

I don't feel threatened by it at all. Probably because my programming skills is what pay my bills at this moment. However, programmers should be much more worried than artists about AI stealing their jobs. ChatGPT feels much more uncanny to me than DALL-E. Still, its outputs always need some human input to adapt to the actual circumstances of the specific project. The same is true for art.

## AI Art VS Generative Art

While AI Art is a subset of Generative Art, Generative Art is not necessarily AI Art.

Generative art is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of techniques and styles, from abstract to figurative, and from procedural to algorithmic. It can be created by humans or by machines, and it can be created by hand or by code.

While AI can be seen as a threat to many, it cannot replace the human element that is at the heart of truly creative art.

When photography was invented, many artists feared it would replace their work. But it didn't. It became a new medium, and artists adapted to it by using it to create new kinds of art. The same will happen with AI art. It will be a new medium, and artists will adapt to it by using it to create new kinds of art.

The art profession is not going anywhere. It will continue to evolve, and it will continue to be a source of inspiration and joy for people around the world. It will continue to be a source of income for artists, and it will continue to be a source of value for collectors and consumers of art.
