# CREATIVE PROCESS

I have a Trello board to manage this process and save the files in Dropbox.

Currently, they're all in Dropbox. The Trello board contains the columns for the process defined here, but it is currently empty.

@todo: I have to build an automated pipeline to organize this process, and upload files from Dropbox to this repository, track the status using Trello, and move them here as well.

## Steps

This is the process. I will call it [PPAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6BUPvE2sM):
