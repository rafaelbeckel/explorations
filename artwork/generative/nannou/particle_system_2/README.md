# Particle System 2

## January 27th, 2023

For this second particle system, I want to start exploring wgpu.

The first one is mesmerizing and fun to look at, but I'm limited to about 2000 particles because it's all calculated in the CPU.

A few years ago, I did this excellent [Vulkan Tuturial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) in C++, and I found out [there is one for Rust](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/) as well. Let's give it a try.

I will start by follwing the tutorial, learn Vulkan and Vulkano first (the Vulkan library used and re-exported by Nannou) and then I will try to make something interesting using Nannou.

I might try to build something similar in Wgpu as well, to get familiar with the graphics ecosystem in Rust.

Sounds like a plan. Let's go!
