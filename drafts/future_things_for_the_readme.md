# Topics, Projects and Tools

- Programming languages: I am particularly interested in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a systems programming language known for its performance and safety features.
- Creative coding: I enjoy using frameworks such as [Nannou](https://nannou.cc/), [P5.js](https://p5js.org/), and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to create interactive and generative artworks.
- Graphics programming: I am fascinated by the power of technologies like [WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/), [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/), [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/), and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) to create stunning graphics and visuals.
- Traditional and digital artworks: I enjoy working with a variety of mediums, including graphite and charcoal, oil paint, and digital tools like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [Procreate](https://procreate.art/). All artworks included in this repository are licensed under creative commons with attribution because sharing is caring.

[To mention other programming languages I have used or learned in the past]

# Projects

### Vista Programming Language

A procedural domain-specific programming language for painting. It is intended to express my intentions and process of my rendered artworks. Current status: idea. I am currently studying language design and skilling up in oil painting before venturing into this direction.

(the text below was auto-generated. It does not represent my actual projects, but I may pick something from there to include in the actual text)

Articles

    Introduction to Rust for Artists: In this article, I provide an introduction to Rust for artists and creative coders, covering the basics of the language and its potential for art and design projects.
    Creating Interactive Art with Nannou: This article explores the Nannou framework for creative coding, including examples of interactive artworks and tips for getting started.
    Exploring WebGPU for Graphics Programming: This article covers the basics of WebGPU, a new graphics API for the web that has the potential to revolutionize the way we create graphics-intensive applications.
    Oil Painting Techniques for Digital Artists: In this article, I share some tips and techniques for incorporating traditional oil painting techniques into digital artworks.

Code

    Rust ray tracer: This is a simple ray tracer written in Rust, demonstrating the language's potential for graphics programming.
    Nannou particle system: This is a particle system created with the Nannou framework, featuring interactive controls and dynamic behavior.
    WebGPU terrain generation: This code example demonstrates how to use WebGPU to generate terrain in real-time, using noise functions and mesh data.

Artwork

    Graphite and charcoal drawings: This folder contains a selection of graphite and charcoal drawings, showcasing my skills in traditional media.
    Oil paintings: This folder features a selection of oil paintings, both traditional and digital, exploring various subjects and styles.
    Digital creations with Blender and Procreate: This folder contains a variety of digital artworks created with Blender and Procreate, including 3D models, animations, and digital paintings.

Pet Projects

    Real-time graphics engine: This is a personal project in which I am building a custom graphics engine from scratch, using WebGPU and Rust.
    Procedural landscape generator: This is a project in which I am experimenting with procedural generation techniques to create dynamic, realistic landscapes.

I hope you find inspiration in my personal explorations, and that you enjoy exploring the content in this repository.

## What I will purposely leave out

There are many articles about Software Engineering and building software in a business environment.

This is primarily about having fun and exploring weird or niche technology that may produce something beautiful in the end.
