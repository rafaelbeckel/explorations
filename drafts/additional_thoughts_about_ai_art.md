## How I use AI in my Art

Let's start by saying I do **not** use image-generation tools in my art. A primary driver for my explorations is deep understanding of what I'm drawing or building, and generating images from a prompt steals this experience.

Sometimes I spend my free DALL-E monthly credits to generate some random garbage that nobody will see besides me. It's a personal moodboard of sorts, but less than 1% of my sources of inspiration. I mainly use it for the lulz, like I do by following `r/weirddalle` on Reddit.

I don't feel threatened by it at all. Probably because my programming skills is what pay my bills at this moment. However, programmers should be much more worried than artists about AI stealing their jobs. ChatGPT feels much more uncanny to me than DALL-E. Still, its outputs always need some human input to adapt to the actual circumstances of the specific project. The same is true for art.

I do mix handcrafted software with traditional drawing and painting, because I believe both are forms of art.

However, as much as I can see the ethical implications that . I do not feel personally threatened by AI art (and AI code generation too, to ), and I do not think it will kill traditional art. I think it's important to understand why.

I think engineers are in a much more likely to be replaced, but they usually do not care

Go to ChatGPT. Type something like "write a program in "

As uncanny it may be, you still need a human to acess the quality of the output and adapt it to the specific needs of you project.

- It's part of my profession as an engineer to keep up to date with the reserach and the tech behind it. I'm by no means an expert, but I do have a basic understanding of the concepts and the tech behind it, and I constantly experiment with them.

I feel conflicted

- I do occasionally use AI image generation as a personal moodboard or for pure amusement, because of the quirky and weird results that these systems can produce.

. Most of my prompts generate I find it interesting to see the quirky and sometimes weird results that AI image generation can produce, and it can be a fun way to find new ideas or to spark creativity.

- However, I also recognize that AI art raises a number of complex and nuanced issues, including questions about authorship, authenticity, and the ethical implications of using AI in art. I believe that it is important for artists and creators to consider these issues carefully and to be thoughtful in their approach to using AI in their work.

-
- TL;DR AI Art won't kill traditional art, software engineers should be much more scared than artists and they just don't care.

As professionals in creative or intellectual fields, our role is to push the boundaries of the profession.

- AI won't steal my job, neither as an artist or as an engineer. There's no way it can pull this off in my lifetime.
